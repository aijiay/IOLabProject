Project description (what it does, how you went about it, etc.)
For this project we made a Chrome extension where one can create a new trail of bookmarks by saving all the tabs in the current browser window into a Delicious account.

A fair amount of research went in figuring out how to cope with Chrome’s security requirement and how to access and control the browser through javascript. It was a fun experience. We also decided to familiarize ourselves with Bootstrap for its popularity; hence we chose it as the basis for our front end. We also had fun using Bootstrap’s UI controls and elements.

We also learned a lot about debugging javascript. Initially we used a lot of alert popups to debug, only to realize that they disrupted the synchronicity of the functions. Instead, logging in the console proved to be non-disruptive.
